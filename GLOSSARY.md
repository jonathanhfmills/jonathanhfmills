# Glossary — git-orchestrator

## Project
A client or personal codebase mounted as a git submodule under `src/<repo-name>`.
_Avoid_: repo, app, site

## Work Item
An issue tracker work item with a unique ID (e.g. `PROJ-42`). The atomic unit of planned work. Work items close only on lead developer sign-off — not on commit, not on GitHub issue close.
_Avoid_: ticket, task, issue, card, story (unless quoting issue tracker hierarchy)

## Daily Log
The `docs/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD.md` file recording completed and in-progress work items for a given day. Seed each new log from the `docs/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD.md` template. Line items use Conventional Commits tags only — HITL classification tags belong in TASKS.md, not here.
_Avoid_: task file, daily standup, journal

## Backlog
`TASKS.md` at the repo root. Forward-looking list of upcoming work items, used for meeting prep and planning. Contains only pending items — completed items belong in the Daily Log only, never in the Backlog.
_Avoid_: todo, roadmap, sprint

## Tag
A prefix on each line item in the Daily Log that classifies the type of change. Maps directly to the Conventional Commits type in the resulting commit message.
_Avoid_: label, type, category

## ADR
An architectural decision record in `docs/adr/`. Records hard-to-reverse, surprising decisions at the orchestrator level only. Each ADR is immutable — if a decision changes, write a new ADR that supersedes the old one. Format: Status → Context → Decision → Considered Options → Consequences.
_Avoid_: design doc, RFC (unless the project adopts those explicitly)

## Architecture Document
`ARCHITECTURE.md` at the repo root. Living description of the orchestrator's current structure, project layout, commit flow, and ADR index. Updated when structure changes (not when decisions change — that belongs in a new ADR).
_Avoid_: system overview, design doc

## Sub-submodule
A nested git submodule inside a Project. Changes require a branch and a PR into `main`; never commit directly to its `main`.
_Avoid_: inner repo, nested repo

## Issue
A GitHub Issue on the orchestrator repo. Canonical tracker for AI-assisted orchestration. The external issue tracker remains source of truth for client-facing work items; Issues mirror or extend them for automation.
_Avoid_: work item (reserved for external tracker items), ticket, card

## HOOTL (Autonomous)
Task classification tag `[HOOTL]`. High confidence, deterministic outcome — AI executes without prompting. Maps to the "Human-Out-of-the-Loop" oversight model: human is auditor only, after the fact.

## HITLFE (Human Required)
Task classification tag `[HITLFE]`. AI does all prep work (analysis, data gathering, file changes), then pauses and presents context for human approval before proceeding.

## HIC (Human-in-Command)
Task classification tag `[HIC]` and the governing philosophy of this system. As tag: marks tasks that are human-only — AI cannot substitute; it surfaces the task and waits. As philosophy: the human developer retains full legal and ethical responsibility for all AI-executed work.
_Avoid_: H-OFF (old name)

## Agentic Workflows
The operational context — AI agents with tool access executing multi-step tasks autonomously, with HITL gates at defined checkpoints rather than at every action.
